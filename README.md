## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up your project using this boilerplate:

```bash
# Clone the repository and cd into the project
git clone https://github.com/zoyron/threejs-boilerplate.git your-project-name
cd your-project-name

# Remove git history and start fresh with your own Git history
rm -rf .git
git init

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Your project is now running at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is occupied).
